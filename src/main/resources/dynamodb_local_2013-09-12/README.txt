Amazon DynamoDB Local
=====================

Amazon DynamoDB Local is a small client-side database and server that mimics the Amazon DynamoDB service. Amazon DynamoDB Local enables you to write applications that use the Amazon DynamoDB API, without actually manipulating any tables or data in Amazon DynamoDB. Instead, all of the API actions are rerouted to Amazon DynamoDB Local. When your application creates a table or modifies data, those changes are written to a local database. This lets you save on provisioned throughput, data storage, and data transfer fees.

Amazon DynamoDB Local is 100% compatible with the Amazon DynamoDB API. When you are ready to deploy your application, you simply redirect it to Amazon DynamoDB, without having to modify your application code.

In addition, you do not need to have an Internet connection to use Amazon DynamoDB Local. You can develop applications without having to be connected to the network.
